# EEZ-BB3 Battery Charging Script

Done
* Set cell count
* set cell voltage
* set charge current
* sets CC and CV parameters based on inputs
* accepts filename for datalogging charge
* datalogs charge
* ~additional view with presets?~ this became the "calculator"
* clean-up python string quoting
* additional view while charging for viewing battery status
* additional view to display stats at end of charge
* button to view datalog


TODO
* default filename based on date/time?
* rename script to something like "CC-CV Battery Charge"
* clean-up python globals, these were copied from other scripts but look
  unnecessary?

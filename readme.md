# EEZ-BB3 Battery Charging Script

Done
* Set cell count
* set cell voltage

TODO
* additional view while charging for viewing battery status
* additional view to display stats at end of charge
* additional view with presets?
* button to view datalog
* default filename based on date/time?
* rename script to something like "CC-CV Battery Charge"
* clean-up python string quoting
* clean-up python globals, these were copied from other scripts but look
  unnecessary?

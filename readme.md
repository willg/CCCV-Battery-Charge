* set charge current
* sets CC and CV parameters based on inputs
* accepts filename for datalogging charge
* datalogs charge
* ~additional view with presets?~ this became the "calculator"
* clean-up python string quoting
* additional view while charging for viewing battery status
* additional view to display stats at end of charge

TODO
* select output channel?
* add maximum charge time?
* fix exit buttom behaviour in nested loops

  unnecessary?
